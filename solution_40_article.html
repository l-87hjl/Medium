<h1>Solution 40: JPL Just Gave 3I/ATLAS Its Final Exam—Nature Grades on December 19</h1>

<p>Eleven days before the most anticipated astronomical observation of 2025, JPL quietly updated an orbit solution. No press release. No dramatic announcement. Just a new entry in the Small-Body Database: Solution 40 for interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, dated December 8, 2025, 08:38:26 UTC.</p>

<p>While NASA maintains its full communications apparatus (tweets about Hubble images, FAQ pages, live Q&A events with officials), the actual mathematical foundation for everything got updated in complete silence. JPL basically just said "here's our homework" eleven days before the exam.</p>

<p>But Solution 40 isn't just another orbit update. It's JPL committing to a specific model of what's pushing 3I/ATLAS around, establishing the exact baseline that December 19 will test. This is how science <em>should</em> work: math first, then nature's verdict. The question is whether it will work that way.</p>

<h2>What Solution 40 Actually Says</h2>

<p>JPL's latest solution incorporates 751 observations through December 6. That's a staggering amount of data. That's "we really, really measured this thing" levels of precision. The residuals come in at 0.40998, which in orbit-fitting terms translates to "yeah, we nailed it."</p>

<p>But Solution 40 does more than just fit positions. It commits to a specific physical model:</p>

<p><strong>Three-axis non-gravitational acceleration</strong>: A1 = +4.64×10⁻⁸ au/day² (radial), A2 = +1.93×10⁻⁸ au/day² (transverse), A3 = -5.06×10⁻⁹ au/day² (out-of-plane).</p>

<p><strong>CO₂ sublimation law</strong>: g(r) = (1/r)², the standard form for carbon dioxide outgassing.</p>

<p><strong>Required mass loss</strong>: ~150 kg/s total gas production (CO₂: 129 kg/s, CO: 14 kg/s, H₂O: 6.6 kg/s, based on JWST observations).</p>

<p>This isn't hedged language or "unknown volatile" hand-waving. JPL picked CO₂ specifically, fit three dimensions of acceleration, and published exact numbers with uncertainties (<a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=3i&view=OPC">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=3i&view=OPC</a>). Producer: Davide Farnocchia, one of the world's top experts in orbit determination.</p>

<p>They showed their work. All of it.</p>

<h2>Why CO₂ Makes Sense</h2>

<p>The CO₂ model isn't "unobtainium from planet Handwavius." It's literally the stuff in your soda. At 3I's current distance (perihelion at 1.36 AU, now ~1.8 AU), water ice would be barely active. CO₂ is the volatile that keeps going like the Energizer Bunny, exactly what you'd need for sustained acceleration this far from the Sun.</p>

<p>The g(r) = (1/r)² law isn't a fudge factor either. It's actual sublimation physics, the right functional form for CO₂ at these distances. JPL did the homework correctly.</p>

<p>Most importantly, the mass budget actually works. At ~150 kg/s loss over months, a 0.5-1 km nucleus loses only ~0.6% of its mass. Unlike ʻOumuamua's "hydrogen iceberg" or "nitrogen ice" proposals (which Loeb demolished by showing they'd sublimate away in less than 20 million years), 3I's mass budget is internally consistent.</p>

<p>The physics works. That's JPL's strength.</p>

<h2>Where the Tension Lives</h2>

<p>But then there are the oddities. Each individually explainable, but together forming a pattern that makes you squint.</p>

<p><strong>The missing coma</strong>: CO₂ sublimates, produces gas, gas should scatter light, multiple observatories (including HST) should detect something. Result? Nothing. It's like claiming someone's cooking a steak but there's no smoke, no smell, no sizzle. Could be sous vide. Could also be... not a steak.</p>

<p><strong>The A2/A1 ratio</strong>: Normal comets show transverse-to-radial acceleration ratios around 0.03-0.05. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko? 0.035. 3I/ATLAS? 0.42. That's not slightly high, that's "please explain yourself" high. Roughly 10 times what you'd expect. To get a ratio that high from jets, you need geometry so specific it's like throwing darts blindfolded and hitting bullseye. Possible? Sure. Convenient? Hmm.</p>

<p><strong>The magnitude behavior</strong>: The brightness variation (K1=4.5) suggests significant activity, but the coma detector says 404 not found.</p>

<p><strong>The pattern</strong>: One weird thing equals quirky. Two weird things equals interesting. Three-plus weird things equals "are we being gaslit by a space rock?"</p>

<p>JPL isn't dumb. They see the same tensions we do. They're just doing the math and going "well, THIS is what fits..." And they put it on the record: Solution 40, all public, all traceable, producer credited.</p>

<h2>What December 19 Tests (Be Specific)</h2>

<p>With Solution 40 as baseline, December 19 becomes a binary test. 3I/ATLAS will be 1.798 AU from Earth. Close enough for good observations but still distant enough to be safe.</p>

<p><strong>If the CO₂ model is correct:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Coma becomes visible (should be detectable now)</li>
<li>Jets appear in high-resolution imaging</li>
<li>Acceleration continues following the (1/r)² law</li>
<li>Any future Solution 41 shows stable A1/A2/A3 ratios</li>
<li>Brightness behavior matches outgassing expectations</li>
</ul>

<p>We should see SOMETHING. Gas, dust, literally any evidence this thing is sublimating. December 19 is basically: "OK fine, PROVE IT."</p>

<p><strong>If the CO₂ model is strained:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Weak/absent coma despite being in the active sublimation zone</li>
<li>Acceleration stronger or weaker than (1/r)² predicts</li>
<li>A1/A2/A3 ratios shift (suggesting multi-phase behavior)</li>
<li>Need to invoke exotic volatiles or multiple mechanisms</li>
</ul>

<p>"Actually, it's not CO₂, it's... uh... nitrogen popsicle?" (The ʻOumuamua playbook, anyone?)</p>

<p><strong>If the CO₂ model breaks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No coma at all</li>
<li>Acceleration doesn't follow sublimation law</li>
<li>Have to either invent new comet physics or admit no natural explanation fits</li>
</ul>

<p>At that point you either add epicycles to your model or admit the model isn't modeling the right thing.</p>

<p>The numbers will show. If 3I isn't where Solution 40 predicts, the acceleration model is wrong. If the NG acceleration doesn't follow the (1/r)² law, the CO₂ model is wrong. This is testable, falsifiable science. JPL put specific predictions on the table.</p>

<p>Even the Earth approach distance changed: Solution 40 puts 3I arriving 1 minute later and 10,000 km farther than gravity-only predictions. Tiny, but measurable.</p>

<h2>The Jupiter Coincidence (Or: Why March 16 Also Matters)</h2>

<p>Solution 40's parameters don't just predict December 19. They also determine where 3I will be on March 16, 2026, when it reaches Jupiter. And here's where it gets genuinely weird.</p>

<p>With the NG acceleration included, 3I approaches Jupiter at 53.445 (±0.06) million km. Jupiter's Hill radius on that date? 53.502 million km.</p>

<p>These match within one standard deviation.</p>

<p>The Hill radius is the boundary where Jupiter's gravity dominates over the Sun's. Inside that radius, Jupiter can capture satellites or debris. Outside, the Sun pulls them away. It's the edge of Jupiter's gravitational domain.</p>

<p>Without the NG acceleration, 3I would have missed this radius entirely. The acceleration shifted the trajectory by roughly 0.1 million km. Just enough to bring 3I to the edge of Jupiter's Hill sphere.</p>

<p>Statistical likelihood of this coincidence: less than 0.00004 (0.004%). One in 25,000.</p>

<p>So the NG acceleration not only explains 3I's motion, it also "steered" it to Jupiter's Hill sphere. Neat trick for sublimating ice.</p>

<p>Statisticians will say "0.004% isn't impossible!" And they're right. But it's WEIRD though. It's like throwing a dart at a dartboard from across the room, blindfolded, while spinning, and hitting bullseye. Could happen! Probably won't.</p>

<p>If you wanted to visit Jupiter's neighborhood without actually hitting Jupiter, this is exactly where you'd aim.</p>

<p>Here's the uncomfortable truth: "The comet is headed exactly where natural physics says it should go" and "the comet is headed to a one-in-25,000 coincidence at Jupiter's gravity boundary" are both technically true statements. Both accurate. Both deeply uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Why this matters: If Solution 40's CO₂ model holds through December, then March 16 becomes the next test. Does 3I arrive at Jupiter where Solution 40 predicts? Does the NG acceleration continue following the (1/r)² law? Or does something change?</p>

<p>And if something does change, if 3I "adjusts" its path near Jupiter, that's when things get really interesting.</p>

<h2>The Strain Level: Honest Assessment</h2>

<p>On a scale of 1-10 (1 = "fits perfectly", 10 = "model broken"), I'd rate this at <strong>6.5-7</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Why not higher:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The orbit fits work (good residuals: 0.40998)</li>
<li>CO₂ is physically plausible at this distance</li>
<li>The parameters are stable and well-constrained</li>
<li>The mass budget is consistent</li>
<li>Nothing violates physics</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why not lower:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The missing coma is genuinely weird</li>
<li>The A2/A1 ratio is suspiciously high (10x normal)</li>
<li>The brightness behavior doesn't match the activity signature</li>
<li>The Jupiter Hill sphere coincidence is statistically uncomfortable</li>
<li>Every individually-explainable oddity compounds into a pattern</li>
</ul>

<p>The right metaphor: It's like building IKEA furniture where every piece goes in smoothly but somehow the chair is facing backwards. Or a jigsaw puzzle where every piece fits but the final image looks wrong.</p>

<p>The math says "comet." The telescope says "where though?"</p>

<p>We've gone from "weird comet" to "comet that's really committed to the bit of not looking like a comet."</p>

<p>The residual RMS is actually good. The orbit fits well. The problem isn't the math, it's what the math is trying to explain. Unlike ʻOumuamua's problematic exotic ice models, 3I's physics is internally consistent. Just... weird.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters Beyond 3I</h2>

<p>Two interstellar objects now. Both show NG acceleration. Both lack clear cometary signatures.</p>

<p>ʻOumuamua: "Weird object does weird thing." Science: "Probably a comet!"</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS: "Another weird object does the same weird thing." Science: "Also probably a comet!"</p>

<p>At what point do we ask: "Are we the baddies?"</p>

<p>Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... we're gonna need a better comet model.</p>

<p>ʻOumuamua got the same treatment: unexplained NG acceleration, no coma, eventually "explained" with exotic ice models (hydrogen icebergs, nitrogen ice). Now 3I is following the same pattern, except 3I actually has observational evidence of outgassing, just not the visible coma you'd expect.</p>

<p>And now 3I is headed to Jupiter's Hill sphere with a 0.004% coincidence rate. ʻOumuamua didn't have a planetary close approach for comparison. 3I does. March 16 will be its own test.</p>

<p>One anomalous interstellar object is an outlier. Two is a pattern. If 3I's natural explanation fails, the probability calculus shifts dramatically.</p>

<h2>The Institutional Question (Not About JPL)</h2>

<p>JPL is doing transparent science. Davide Farnocchia and his team are some of the most credentialed, brilliant mathematicians on Earth. They can calculate orbital mechanics to nine decimal places. They're showing their work, publishing their data, doing everything right.</p>

<p>The question isn't about JPL's math. The question is about what happens next.</p>

<p>Watch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does imaging data come out promptly or get delayed?</li>
<li>Does Solution 41 quietly shift parameters after December 19?</li>
<li>How is any negative result framed?</li>
<li>Is it "inconclusive" or honestly null?</li>
</ul>

<p>JPL equals transparent nerds doing transparent math. NASA communications equals... [nervous sweating].</p>

<p>"Data quality concerns" is the institutional equivalent of "read: 11:43 PM."</p>

<p>For example: Avi Loeb has been asking for HiRISE images from October 2, working with Congress to get them released. That's the kind of data access issue to watch for. Not JPL withholding (they don't make those calls). But institutional apparatus around them deciding what gets released when, and how it's framed.</p>

<p>The data will either drop on December 19, or it'll get "peer reviewed" until March.</p>

<p>JPL does the math. NASA decides what the math "means." Those are different jobs.</p>

<p>Here's the beautiful irony: These are some of the smartest people on the planet. PhDs, professorships, decades of experience calculating trajectories with precision most of us can't even conceptualize. And in eleven days, a rock from another star system gets to grade their paper.</p>

<p>No appeals process. No committee review. Just: "Here's what actually happened."</p>

<p>The power dynamic is inverted. Usually scientists test nature. This time, nature tests the scientists. Publicly. With a clear pass/fail.</p>

<h2>11 Days (and Then 98 More)</h2>

<p>Solution 40 is on the table. Nature responds December 19.</p>

<p>Either the CO₂ model saves itself, or astronomy has to decide: stretch natural explanations further, or admit ignorance.</p>

<p>This is how science <em>should</em> work—testable predictions, public data, clear outcomes. The question is whether it <em>will</em> work that way.</p>

<p>Science says: "We made a prediction! We'll test it publicly!"</p>

<p>Also science: "Wait, can we test it privately first?"</p>

<p>In eleven days, nature either says "yes, CO₂" or "lol no" and there's no appeal process. December 19: Put up or shut up. And we'll know pretty quickly which one astronomy picks.</p>

<p>After December 19, 3I heads toward Jupiter's close approach on March 16, 2026 (0.358 AU from Jupiter, right at the Hill sphere boundary). Every future observation will test whether Solution 40's model holds.</p>

<p>And if 3I arrives at Jupiter's Hill sphere exactly as predicted, threading that one-in-25,000 needle with sublimating ice, well, that's its own kind of answer.</p>

<p>The exam starts in eleven days. The professor is a rock traveling at 65 km/s. The students have PhDs.</p>

<p>Nature grades on a curve of one.</p>
