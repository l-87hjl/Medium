<h1>THE CATEGORY ERROR HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT:</h1>
<h2>Why Science Keeps Getting Stuck With "Unknowns" and How to Fix the Framework</h2>

<p>There's a problem in how science talks about anomalous objects, and it hides so well inside our vocabulary that most people—even scientists—never notice it.</p>

<p>It's like realizing your filing cabinet has been rigged. Three drawers, but only one ever opens, and someone keeps quietly relabeling the tabs while you're not looking. You've been filing everything in the same drawer for years, and only now do you notice: the other two drawers aren't stuck. They're <em>locked</em>. And nobody's asking who has the key.</p>

<p>What I'm talking about is simple to state but surprisingly deep:</p>

<blockquote>Science uses a degree-based scale to describe natural anomalies, but treats artificial/technological origin as if it were just the final stage of weirdness rather than a fundamentally different category.</blockquote>

<p>It's not just inaccurate. It structurally prevents certain explanations from ever being considered.</p>

<p>This isn't an argument for ETs; it's an argument for clean epistemology. But ironically, fixing the epistemology is the only way ETs could even be considered neutrally.</p>

<p>Let's pull the architecture apart.</p>

<hr>

<h2>I. The Hidden Structure Behind Scientific Language</h2>

<p>When astronomers classify an unexpected object, the vocabulary unfolds along a very predictable line:</p>

<p><strong>Atypical → Exotic → Unknown (physics/mechanism) → Unprecedented → Artificial/Technological</strong></p>

<p>The problem is that everything up through "unprecedented" is a degree term. And every single one of those degree terms silently assumes natural origin.</p>

<p>Natural isn't stated—it's smuggled in behind the adjectives.</p>

<p>The slider isn't a neutral measurement tool; it's a natural-only scale that has had "artificial" hastily glued to one end like a last-minute science-fair project. You can almost see the dried Elmer's.</p>

<p>This is a category mistake masquerading as a spectrum.</p>

<hr>

<h2>II. The Consequence: Infinite "Unknowns"</h2>

<p>Here's the trap:</p>

<p>The "unknown" category is unbounded. It can always expand one more step, absorb one more anomaly, invent one more mechanism, propose one more unseen volatile, one more untested law.</p>

<p>That means technological explanations are never actually reached, because the natural side has:</p>

<ul>
<li>infinite elasticity,</li>
<li>no structural boundary,</li>
<li>and no point at which it must justify continuing to inflate itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Unknown" and "exotic" are open-ended buckets. They can always stretch one more step.</p>

<p>And here's the killer: if technological only appears after every unknown model change is exhausted, then technological will never be considered.</p>

<p>This is the infinite-unknowns problem, and it exists not because scientists are irrational, but because the taxonomy itself is built this way. It's a filing cabinet with one drawer bloated enough to tip the whole thing forward—and everyone just keeps jamming more files in there.</p>

<hr>

<h2>III. Where the Category Break Actually Lives</h2>

<p>In physics, the world divides neatly between:</p>

<p>1. <strong>Natural processes</strong> – impersonal, unguided, emergent</p>

<p>2. <strong>Artificial processes</strong> – intentional, engineered structures made by agents</p>

<p>Exotic, unknown, unprecedented—these are all degrees of natural deviation.<br>
Artificial/technological is a different <em>kind</em> of thing.</p>

<p>Artificial isn't "maximum weird natural." It's a different kind of thing.</p>

<p>Trying to treat these as points on the same slider is like saying:</p>

<p>"This soup is slightly spicy, moderately spicy, extremely spicy, unknown-physics spicy... and finally, made-by-a-person spicy."</p>

<p>One of these is not a flavor.</p>

<hr>

<h2>IV. The Forbidden Third Bucket: Not Natural, Not Man-Made</h2>

<p>We have only two allowed buckets:</p>

<ul>
<li>natural</li>
<li>human-made</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything not human-made is automatically assigned to natural, even if the object in question shows properties that—were we looking at our own machines—we would immediately classify as engineered.</p>

<p>Here's the contradiction: We don't assume a rocket is natural or an unknown phenomenon. So why do only man-made things get this privilege?</p>

<p>There's no rule of physics that bans extraterrestrials from having an effect on physics.</p>

<p>Physics doesn't exclude non-human engineering. Our classification habits do.</p>

<p>In other words: ET technology is physically allowed but conceptually forbidden.</p>

<p>That's an epistemic red flag, not an evidentiary one.</p>

<hr>

<h2>V. Why No One Has Fixed This Yet (The Convenient Blind Spot)</h2>

<p>Let's be clear about what's happening here.</p>

<p>This isn't an innocent oversight. This is a classification structure so obviously biased that pointing it out forces one of two responses: fix it, or admit you're avoiding something on purpose.</p>

<p>Guess which option preserves more careers?</p>

<p>Here's the thing: everyone involved is <em>technically</em> doing their job.</p>

<p>Astronomers are modeling unknowns. (That's astronomy.)<br>
Philosophers are avoiding reputational quicksand. (That's philosophy.)<br>
SETI is listening for signals. (That's what the acronym says.)<br>
Sociologists study institutional behavior while carefully not studying <em>this</em> institutional behavior.</p>

<p>The system works perfectly—if the goal is to never arrive at certain conclusions.</p>

<p>Naturalism gets infinite vocabulary. "Unknown physics" becomes the intellectual equivalent of "I'll get to it later"—which in science can mean decades of well-funded later. And artificial explanations? They get a corner office no one visits.</p>

<p>And here's the kicker: this is happening <em>after</em> Tic Tac. After 'Oumuamua. After official UAP acknowledgment. We're post-revelatory, and the response is... more unknowns. More exotic volatiles. More "let's workshop this natural explanation for another decade."</p>

<p>Spitting in the face of curiosity while calling yourself a scientist isn't rigor. It's embarrassment with footnotes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>VI. The Dual-Axis Fix (The Structural Correction)</h2>

<p>Here's the fix:</p>

<p><strong>Axis 1 — Degree / Model Strain</strong> (Independent of origin)<br>
Typical → Atypical → Exotic → Unknown → Unprecedented</p>

<p><strong>Axis 2 — Origin Category</strong><br>
Natural / Human-engineered / Non-human engineered / Underdetermined</p>

<p>This does something crucial: it separates degrees from categories.</p>

<p>The goal is to look at things in terms of degree objectively, and then evaluate the degree to which that adjective applies to a category.</p>

<p>Once degree and origin are separated, the infinite-unknowns loophole closes.</p>

<p>Suddenly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exotic natural is no longer infinite.</li>
<li>Unknown physics can't expand forever without justification.</li>
<li>Artificial becomes a valid branch at any degree of anomaly, not the forbidden end of a slider.</li>
</ul>

<p>The system becomes honest.</p>

<p>And here's what that honesty looks like: you can have an exotic natural object, an exotic artificial object, or an object whose origin remains underdetermined while you figure out what the hell it is. The weirdness doesn't tell you where it came from. The weirdness just tells you it's weird.</p>

<p>That's not radical. That's just... correct.</p>

<hr>

<h2>VII. What This Unlocks</h2>

<p>Once the dual-axis structure exists, the inference landscape changes dramatically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Neutrality is restored.</li>
<li>Naturalism is no longer a hidden prior.</li>
<li>Artificial explanations stop being "unreachable."</li>
<li>Unknown physics stops being a bottomless pit.</li>
<li>Origin becomes a real scientific variable, not a taboo.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the truth becomes explicit: this was never about arguing for aliens. This was about arguing for a classification system that doesn't cheat.</p>

<p>With the dual-axis structure in place, the field gains something it has never had before: an ontology that recognizes natural, human-made, and non-human-made as parallel categories, not endpoints on a single spectrum.</p>

<p>This is the contribution no one else has articulated. Not SETI. Not astrophysics. Not philosophy of science. Not the anomaly literature.</p>

<p>It's not complicated. It's just that nobody wanted to say it out loud.</p>

<hr>

<h2>VIII. Closing: The Simple Fix to an Old Problem</h2>

<p>The problem is old. The fix is simple. But seeing it required someone willing to look at the filing cabinet and ask why two of the drawers are locked.</p>

<p>If we want a scientific framework capable of handling whatever the universe throws at us—whether natural, unknown, or engineered—then the structure has to change.</p>

<p>Degree is one axis. Origin is another. Everything else is noise.</p>

<p>The moment the axes split, the blind spot disappears.</p>

<p>And suddenly the filing cabinet stands upright.</p>
